#### The `connection` object represents an access right to a end-user's software.

```json JSON
{
  "id_connection": "6cd057cb-39df-44ce-9be8-ab9d167c3940",
  "status": "valid",

}
```

A `connection` is created once a user completes the auth granting access flow (through [magic-link](/core-concepts/magic-links) or inside [code](/core-concepts/embedded-catalog)).

`connection_token` is **mandatory** for each **unified API request**.

### It helps Panora get important data

- metadata about the software where the data has to be fetched/created (e.g _provider & vertical_).
- private encrypted credentials **(access_token/refresh_token)** to make the requests on behalf of the user.
