## Connectors powering the Panora API

All connectors are within the `@panora/shared` (in the `metadata.ts` file) package which can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@panora/shared).

The **source of truth** is contained within this [**object**](https://github.com/panoratech/Panora/blob/main/packages/shared/src/connectors/metadata.ts#L6) :

```ts 
CONNECTORS_METADATA: ProvidersConfig
```
