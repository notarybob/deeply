#### The `linked-user` object represents a user entity inside our system.

```json JSON
{
  "id_linked_user": "6cd057cb-39df-44ce-9be8-ab9d167c3940",
  "linked_user_origin_id": "acme-id-be129f-4nce-uh22",
  "alias": "acme",
  "id_project": "6cd057cb-39df-44ce-9be8-ab9d167c3940"
}
```

- `id_linked_user` is the **id** of the user inside **our** system.
- `linked_user_origin_id` is the **id** of the user inside **your** system.
- `alias` is the name of your system/company. <br/>

It holds information about **user's data**
that exist in your **own product**.

The idea is to have a deep copy of all your user's information inside our own database.
