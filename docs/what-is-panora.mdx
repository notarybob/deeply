We are a universal API that allows you to sync data from multiple third-party platforms.
We maintain standardized models across all verticals.
Panora works by enabling your customers to seamlessly connect their diverse data sources (CRM systems, File Storage platforms, Ticketing tools, etc.) to your application. <br/>

This integration process is streamlined through [Panora Magic Link](/core-concepts/magic-links), our user-friendly interface that provides a secure and elegant authorization flow. Here, your customers can select their preferred providers and authorize access to their various data systems.<br/>
Upon successful connection, Panora issues a connection token to your application, which you can use to make API requests to Panora's endpoints. This token grants you access to a wealth of standardized data for a sepcific third-party.<br/>


What sets Panora apart is its advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline capabilities. As part of our service, you can leverage Panora's [chunking and embedding functionalities for enhanced retrieval search](/rag/index). This feature allows you to efficiently process and search through large volumes of connected data, enabling more accurate and context-aware information retrieval in your applications.<br/>
By integrating Panora, you're not just connecting data sources â€“ you're unlocking the power of intelligent data processing and retrieval, all through a single, unified API.
