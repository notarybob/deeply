Unfortunately, webhooks aren’t always available. Many Third Party applications don’t support real time events. But rest assured, Panora has you covered! With our robust polling technology, our servers will automatically check for new records created/updated and proxy those changes to your application in near real-time.

## Periodic Sync

By default, for every single linked account that you may have, we sync all 3rd parties they've connected across all common models.
These sync jobs are done every 8 hours.


You can enable custom sync frequencies for your category. 
Go to Configurations page, and apply the frequency to the category you wish to receive data for.

**You can also the API, just select a number of seconds for the vertical you want to have custom sync.**

  ```shell Curl
  curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.panora.dev/sync/pull_frequencies \
        --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
          "crm": 300, 
          "hris": 0,
          "ticketing": 0,
          "accounting": 0,
          "ats": 0,
          "ecommerce": 0,
          "hris": 0,
          "filestorage": 0,
        }'
  ```

Here I just set up data to be synced every 5 minutes (300 seconds) for the CRM category.
