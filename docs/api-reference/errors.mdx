Panora uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: <br/>Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. <br/>Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, etc.). <br/>Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Panoraâ€™s servers (these are rare).

Some `4xx` errors that could be handled programmatically include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.
